My solution to the [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/) problem.

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
```
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

Note: All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.
